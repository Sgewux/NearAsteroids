# NearAsteroids
Python script wich will display a table with the near asteroid's names, diameters, relative velocity, and other information.
Using the NeoWs NASA API.

## How does it work?

The script gets your pc's date and do a request to the API according your current date, using the JSON module to decode the API's response the script obtains the data and after that the script tabulates the data using the tabulate Python module. 

## Requirements

- Python (i used Python 3.8.5)

- requests 2.25.1

- tabulate 0.8.7
